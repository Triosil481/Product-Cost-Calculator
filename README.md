# Tester-Tester

This repository will be used to create a webapp for my company to help in simplifying some tasks.

The first task will help me get the cost of a product that I want to sell:

    There are many products made in the sompany and each use a different recipe to make it, with varying quantities and costs. I want to be able to input the recipe and get the cost of the product based on it.

    the cost will be split into three:
        Material cost
        Labor cost
        Overhead cost
    
    Based on the above the resources will be organised accordingly.

    In regards to Material costs, they will be the ones changing the most in this program, due to the fluctuating costs of supplies in the market and that needs to be taken into consideration when making the code. As such, we wil be going with the following:
        
        The cost of the Materials should be easily changeable by the administrator
        The code written should not tightly couple the item with its cost
